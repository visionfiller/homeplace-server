# HomePlace
My app solves the problem of those who want a change of scenery, and are bored of the day to day of their house. With my app, users can view and swap homes in the area for a mini vacation, while still being home to go to work, eat at their favorite restaurants, etc. They have the opportunity to visit parks or restaurants that were previously too far to go to because they were not in the neighborhood. Customers can swap homes that have pools, big yards, better locations. It is a community type of system, where the swaps are based on the current value of the home they are offering. To participate in a swap, the customer must have their home listed.

The key features of HomePlace include:

1. Home Swapping: Users can list their homes and browse through available listings in their area. They can then initiate a swap with another user, allowing them to temporarily live in each other's homes.

2. Expanded Experiences: With your app, users can explore new neighborhoods, visit parks, and dine at restaurants that were previously too far away to conveniently access on a regular basis. This enhances their day-to-day experiences and adds a sense of adventure to their lives.

3. Community-based System: Your app operates on a community-based system, where swaps are based on the current value of the homes being offered. This ensures fairness and provides a sense of security for users.

4. Home Criteria: Users can specify their preferences and requirements for the homes they are looking to swap with. This may include features like pools, big yards, or better locations. The app matches users based on their criteria to ensure a mutually beneficial swap.

5. Listing Requirement: To participate in a swap, customers must have their homes listed on the app. This helps maintain an active community and ensures that there are enough options available for users to choose from.

Overall, HomePlace offers a unique and convenient solution for people seeking a change of scenery without the need for extensive travel. It fosters a community of homeowners looking to swap their homes, allowing them to enjoy new experiences and amenities while still being close to their daily routines.
